Something doesn’t seem to be working properly. Can I get help?
PracticeUpdate is a newly launched site. We rigorously tested under the hood but if something doesn’t seem to be working, please let us know and we will check on it. Rest assured, we will be continuing to improve the site as it grows.
Is there a fee to access the site?
No fees! Premium content is available to users who register with the site. PracticeUpdate is commercially supported by online advertising, sponsorship, and educational grants.
Can I view the site on my mobile device?
Yes! PracticeUpdate is flexible-you can view it from your desktop, tablet and mobile device. The navigation looks different on a mobile device to enable you to have a better viewing experience.
What content is available on PracticeUpdate?
Our editors curate healthcare news and journal scans and provide coverage of top conferences as well as providing expert commentary. The Updates page displays the most current content specific to your preferences, Explore provides you with a wider view of healthcare topics and in Learn, we will be adding additional CME courses and must-read articles for specialties (“Seminal Articles”), conference coverage and more.

No. Elsevier experts provide their own point of view and summary of various published content. We cut through the clutter so you don’t have to. Access to additional published content is available as licensing permission allows.

Yes and no. We provide access to full-text articles based on permissions we have. Full-text articles that are available for free is indicated as such but we always provide you with a link to the source content.

The Learn section is being developed and we will have content such as CME and conference coverage for different specialties soon. For now, we are providing all of our users with the content we have today which is mostly Oncology-related. OncologySTAT Questions

PracticeUpdate provides the same quality, curated content by healthcare experts but we’re expanding beyond just one specialty and we’ve made some improvements.
